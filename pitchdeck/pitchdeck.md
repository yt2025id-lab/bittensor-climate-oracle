# AI Climate Oracle Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title & Tagline
- **Project Name:** AI Climate Oracle
- **Tagline:** Predicting Climate, Empowering Action
- **Logo/Image:** [Insert project logo or climate/AI icon]

## Slide 2: Problem
- Climate data is scattered, not real-time, and hard to verify.
- Weather/climate predictions lack accuracy and transparency.
- No open platform for collaborative climate insights.
- **Image:** Illustration of fragmented data, climate risks.

## Slide 3: Solution
- Bittensor-based AI oracle for real-time, verifiable climate data and predictions.
- Crowdsourcing data and models.
- All data, predictions, and reputation on-chain.
- **Image:** Oracle diagram, Bittensor logo.

## Slide 4: Vision & Mission
- **Vision:** Global, open, accurate, and collaborative climate oracle.
- **Mission:** Provide real-time, verifiable climate data, foster collaboration, ensure transparency.
- **Image:** Globe, network, or environmental visual.

## Slide 5: How It Works
- Data collected from sensors, satellites, crowdsourcing, APIs.
- AI models process and predict climate trends.
- Validators assess quality, miners contribute data/models.
- Rewards in $TAO tokens.
- **Diagram:** Data flow from source to prediction to API.

## Slide 6: Bittensor Integration
- Runs as a Bittensor subnet.
- Uses mining, staking, and smart contracts for trustless operation.
- **Image:** Bittensor network/subnet visual.

## Slide 7: Demo & Impact
- API endpoint: `/predict`.
- Example: Submit a prediction query, receive real-time climate data.
- **Screenshot:** API in action or UI mockup.
