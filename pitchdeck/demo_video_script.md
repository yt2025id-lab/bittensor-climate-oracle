# AI Climate Oracle Demo Video Script

**Max Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## Scene 1: Opening (0:00-0:20)
- [Visual] Project logo, tagline, and climate/AI icons.
- [Voice Over] "Welcome to AI Climate Oracle, the decentralized platform for real-time, transparent climate data and predictions, powered by Bittensor."

## Scene 2: The Problem (0:20-0:40)
- [Visual] Fragmented data, climate risks, lack of transparency.
- [Voice Over] "Climate data is scattered and hard to verify. Predictions lack accuracy and transparency, and there is no open platform for collaboration."

## Scene 3: The Solution (0:40-1:00)
- [Visual] Oracle diagram, Bittensor logo, data flow icons.
- [Voice Over] "Our solution: an AI-powered oracle that collects, processes, and distributes climate data and predictions, with all activities on-chain."

## Scene 4: How It Works (1:00-2:00)
- [Visual] Animation: data collection, AI prediction, validation, reward distribution.
- [Voice Over] "Data is collected from sensors, satellites, and crowdsourcing. AI models process and predict climate trends. Validators assess quality, miners contribute data/models, and rewards are distributed in $TAO tokens."

## Scene 5: Demo (2:00-4:00)
- [Visual] Screen recording:
    - Running the API (`uvicorn main:app --reload`)
    - Submitting a prediction query via `/predict` endpoint (show request/response)
    - (Optional) Show Bittensor node integration or dashboard
- [Voice Over] "Let's see it in action. We start the API, submit a prediction query, and receive real-time climate data. All interactions are transparent and auditable."

## Scene 6: Impact & Closing (4:00-5:00)
- [Visual] Impact stats, testimonials, team photo, contact info.
- [Voice Over] "AI Climate Oracle empowers action with accurate, real-time climate insights. Join us to build a more resilient future."
